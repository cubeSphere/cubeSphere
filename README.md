Interactive Cube is a project, by [Balandino Di Donato](http://www.balandinodidonato.com) and Per-Olov Jernberg, which was born during the [MTFScandi](http://musictechfest.net/category/umea/) [Hackathon](http://musictechfest.net/mtfhacks/).

Interactive Brick is a cube composed by 5 touch screens and the [R-IoT device](http://ismm.ircam.fr/devices/) for manipulating audio through touch and gestures. 
The last face of the cube is left to hardware features such as usb, video, audio and power plugs.

Originally, Interactive Cube called CubeInSphere, it was composed by 5 LED screens and the R-IoT device. 
The screens were displaying a sphere, which position was defined by the R-IoT orientation; instead size and colour driven respectively by the outgoing audio spectrum and amplitude.
Moreover, audio meters were showing the current amplitude of the audio signal.
The results of the audio manipulation was a mix, which was controlled by the R-IoT sensor, of five pre-loaded audio samples.

Today, the Interactive Cube development point at an interactive, open and hackable interactive device, controllable through touch and gesture.

Interactive Cube is a project founded by the [Music Bricks](http://musictechfest.net/musicbricks/).
