CubeSphere is a project born for the #MTFScandi #Hackathon. It is an interactive cube display for manipulating audio. 

The cube is composed by 5 led displays which show the projection of a sphere on each side of the cube. 

The position of the sphere within the cube depends on the position of the cube tracked using the [Riot device](http://ismm.ircam.fr/devices/). 

The cube rotation control the mix of 5 audio loops and audio results define the colour and size of the sphere. Moreover, the movement of the cube drive a stereo panning effect. In addition, the cube has two VU meters which displays the amplitude of the stereo output.
